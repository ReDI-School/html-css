# **BONUS MILESTONE: Personal Portfolio Website**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on building a fully responsive and accessible personal portfolio website. Across Milestone 1, 2 and 3, students learn to implement semantic HTML, advanced CSS techniques, and responsive design to create an interactive and visually appealing portfolio.

This fourth milestone is a bonus milestone. That means you don't need to complete it to hand in the project. If you completed milestone 1-3, then we recommend you to work on the BONUS milestone. If you haven't completed milestone 1-3, then finish them first.

## **Expected Outcome**

## **Steps to Complete the Project**

### **1. Build the HTML Skeleton**

- Use semantic tags to create the structure for:
  - Header with logo and navigation.
  - About section with a brief introduction.
  - Projects section with a responsive grid layout.
  - Contact form with input fields for name, email, and message.

**Code Example:**

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="#about">About</a>
    <a href="#projects">Projects</a>
    <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

---

### **2. Apply Basic CSS Styling**

- Style the header, about section, projects, and contact form using:
  - Colors and fonts for a cohesive theme.
  - Padding and margins for spacing.

**Code Example:**

```css
header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}
```

---

### **3. Add Interactivity with CSS Animations**

- Implement keyframe animations for headers and transitions for buttons.

**Code Example:**

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
h2 {
  animation: fadeIn 1s ease-in-out;
}
```

---

### **4. Make the Website Responsive**

- Use CSS Grid for the projects section with `repeat(auto-fit, minmax())`.
- Add media queries to adjust layouts for smaller screens.

**Code Example:**

```css
.project-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .project-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```
