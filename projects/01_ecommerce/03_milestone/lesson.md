  <h2 class="product-title">Product 1</h2>
  <img src="product1.jpg" alt="Image of Product 1" class="product-image" />
  <p class="product-description">A short description of Product 1.</p>
  <a href="#" class="product-button">Add to Cart</a>
</article>

### **2. Flexbox for Navigation**

Guide students in styling the navigation bar using Flexbox:

- **Key Concepts**:

**Code Example**:

```css
.site-header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}

.navbar {
  display: flex;
  gap: 15px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .navbar {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
  }
}
```

#### **Teaching Tips**:

- Demonstrate how Flexbox simplifies alignment.

### **3. CSS Grid for Product Listings**

Explain the advantages of CSS Grid for creating responsive, multi-column layouts:

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Flexible grid creation using `auto-fit` and `minmax`.
  - Dynamic adjustment of columns based on available space.

**Code Example**:

```css
.product-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}

.product-card {
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 15px;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}
```

#### **Teaching Tips**:

- Explain how `auto-fit` ensures responsive behavior.
- Discuss the importance of spacing (`gap`) for clarity and aesthetics.

### **4. Responsive Design with Media Queries**

Teach students how to use media queries to adapt layouts:

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Adjusting navigation bar orientation.
  - Scaling down padding for smaller screens.

**Code Example**:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .navbar {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
  }

  .product-card {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```

#### **Teaching Tips**:

- Highlight the importance of testing designs on multiple devices.
- Encourage students to think about user experience on smaller screens.

### **5. Adding Interactivity**

Enhance the website with hover effects for links and buttons:

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Visual feedback for interactive elements.
  - Improved usability and engagement.

**Code Example**:

```css
.product-button:hover {
  background-color: #555;
}

.nav-link:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### **Teaching Tips**:

- Show how hover effects guide user interaction.
- Encourage experimentation with different styles.

## **Common Mistakes to Address**

1. **Overusing IDs**:
   - Emphasize that IDs should be unique and used sparingly.
2. **Ignoring Responsive Design**:
   - Remind students to test layouts on different screen sizes.
3. **Improper Use of Grid and Flexbox**:
   - Clarify when to use each technique based on the layout requirements.
