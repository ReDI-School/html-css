## **Classroom Flow**

### **1. Semantic HTML (Week 1)**

Start by explaining the role of semantic HTML in creating accessible and maintainable web pages:

- **Key Elements**:
  - `<header>`: For branding and navigation.
  - `<main>`: For core content like product listings.
  - `<footer>`: For additional information like contact details.

**Code Example**:

```html
<header>
  <img src="logo.png" alt="E-Commerce Logo" />
  <nav>
    <a href="#">Home</a>
    <a href="#">Products</a>
    <a href="#">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

#### **Discussion Prompts**:

- Why is semantic HTML important for accessibility?
- How do semantic tags improve SEO?

### **2. Styling Basics (Week 2)**

Explain how CSS enhances the structure built in Week 1:

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Selectors: Element, class, and ID selectors.
  - Box Model: Padding, borders, and margin for layout control.
  - Styling basics: Colors, fonts, and spacing.

**Code Example**:

```css
header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}
```

#### **Teaching Tips**:

- Demonstrate the effect of the box model on layout and spacing.
- Show how flexbox properties like `justify-content` align content.

### **3. Advanced Layout Techniques (Week 3)**

Guide students in creating responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid:

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Flexbox: Aligning navigation links and footer content.
  - CSS Grid: Structuring product listings dynamically.
  - Media Queries: Adapting designs to smaller screens.

**Code Example**:

```css
section {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  nav {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
  }
}
```

#### **Teaching Tips**:

- Explain the difference between `auto-fit` and `auto-fill` in grid layouts.
- Emphasize the importance of responsive design for user experience.

### **4. Adding Interactivity**

Introduce hover effects for navigation links and buttons:

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Pseudo-classes like `:hover` for interactive elements.
  - Visual feedback for buttons and links.

**Code Example**:

```css
main article a:hover {
  background-color: #555;
  color: white;
}
```

#### **Discussion Prompts**:

- Why is visual feedback important for user interaction?
- How can hover effects improve accessibility?

## **Common Mistakes to Address**

1. **Misuse of Selectors**:

   - Ensure students understand when to use element, class, or ID selectors.

2. **Inconsistent Spacing**:

   - Highlight the importance of uniform padding and margins.

3. **Neglecting Responsiveness**:
   - Stress the importance of testing designs on different screen sizes.
