  ```css
  .header {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    z-index: 100;
  }
  ```

- Show how to style the search bar for better usability:
  ```css
  .search-container input {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px 0 0 4px;

### **3. Products Grid**

The product section showcases items in a responsive grid layout.

#### **Teaching Tips**:

    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
  }
  ```

- Explain how to add hover effects for product cards to make them interactive:

  ```css
  .product-card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-5px);
    box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  }
  ```

- Highlight the role of product actions (e.g., Add to Cart, Wishlist) in eCommerce websites.

    .main-container {
      flex-direction: column;
    }
  }
  ```
- Explain how to modify the grid layout for smaller screens:
  ```css
  .products-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  }
  ```
