## **Project Structure**

### **1. Navigation (Navbar)**

The navigation bar is the starting point of the project. Explain to students the importance of:

- Creating an intuitive user experience with clear navigation.
- Using hover effects to enhance interactivity.

#### **Teaching Tips**

- Introduce the concept of **fixed positioning** with `position: fixed` to keep the navbar visible during scrolling.
- Show how to use pseudo-elements like `::after` to create simple, lightweight animations.

**Practical Example**:

```css
.nav-links a:hover::after {
  width: 100%;
  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

Explain that this technique can be extended to any link or button to create immediate visual feedback.

### **2. Hero Section**

The Hero section is essential for capturing the user's attention immediately upon landing on the site.
This section introduces the portfolio owner with:

- A striking title.
- A brief description.
- Two Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons to guide users to projects or contact information.

#### **Teaching Tips**

- Highlight the importance of centering content with **Flexbox**:
  ```css
  .hero {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
  }
  ```
- Explain how **text-shadow** can enhance text readability:
  ```css
  .hero h1 {
    text-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
  ```
- Emphasize how CTAs should stand out with colors and borders:
  ```css
  .btn-primary {
    background-color: var(--accent-color);
    color: white;
    border-radius: 50px;
    padding: 12px 30px;
  }
  ```

### **3. Projects Section**

The projects section is organized into a grid of cards, each containing:

- A representative image.
- A title.
- A brief description.

#### **Teaching Tips**

- Introduce **CSS Grid** to create responsive layouts with dynamic columns:

  ```css
  .projects-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 30px;
  }
  ```

  Explain how `auto-fit` adapts the number of columns based on the available width.

- Demonstrate how to create **hover effects**:
  ```css
  .project-card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
    box-shadow: 0 15px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  }
  ```
  Highlight that these transitions not only improve aesthetics but also provide immediate visual feedback to the user.

#### **Discussion**

Ask students:

- How can the content within the cards be made more readable?
- What other sections could be added to enrich the portfolio?
